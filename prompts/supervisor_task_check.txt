Given this task:
{task}

and this sequence of response by agents tool usage:
{response}

determine whether or not the task has been successfully completed.

In case the given attempts appear to effectively capture the final result but fall short only
in some minor way, e.g., not properly formatted, you can give a finishing touch and capture
the result of the task in the `final_answer` field. In this case, also set `status` to `True`.
Otherwise, leave `final_answer` empty when there are significant aspects missing or major deviations
noted from the desired ask result.

Tool usage is generally efficient, so in most cases the results can be accepted unless there is some
indication of obvious error.
