    content: "\e[1;32mAgent\e[0m\e[32m: I have found lists of festivals for both Paris and Kolkata. To compare them and identify differences, I need to \e[0m\r\n\e[32manalyze the information I have gathered. \e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[32m**Festivals in Paris:** The search results indicate that Paris has a variety of festivals throughout the year, including\e[0m\r\n\e[32mmusic festivals \e[0m\e[1;32m(\e[0m\e[32mlike Fête de la Musique, Banlieues Bleues\e[0m\e[1;32m)\e[0m\e[32m, cultural events, and general celebrations. The Wikipedia \e[0m\r\n\e[32mentry for \e[0m\e[32m\"Festivals in Paris\"\e[0m\e[32m suggests a broad range of cultural attractions and entertainment contributing to its \e[0m\r\n\e[32mstatus as a global city. Specific examples mentioned include Paris Fashion Week, and general references to art shows, \e[0m\r\n\e[32mmusic festivals, and food fairs. The focus seems to be on a diverse cultural calendar catering to a global audience.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[32m**Festivals in Kolkata:** Kolkata's festivals are heavily influenced by its rich cultural and religious heritage. The \e[0m\r\n\e[32mmost prominent festival is Durga Puja, a major Hindu celebration. Other significant festivals include Diwali, Kali Puja,\e[0m\r\n\e[32mHoli, Saraswati Puja, Poush Parbon, Poila Boishakh \e[0m\e[1;32m(\e[0m\e[32mBengali New Year\e[0m\e[1;32m)\e[0m\e[32m, Christmas, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. There \e[0m\r\n\e[32mare also events like the Kolkata International Cinema Festival and food festivals.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[32m**Differences:**\e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[32m*   **Religious vs. Cultural/Secular Focus:** Kolkata's festivals have a strong religious and traditional Hindu basis, \e[0m\r\n\e[32mwith Durga Puja being the most significant. While Paris also has cultural and religious events \e[0m\e[1;32m(\e[0m\e[32mlike Christmas and Eid\e[0m\e[1;32m)\e[0m\e[32m,\e[0m\r\n\e[32mmany of its highlighted festivals, such as music festivals and fashion week, appear to be more secular or culturally \e[0m\r\n\e[32mdriven, catering to a broader international audience.\e[0m\r\n\e[32m*   **Scale and Nature of Major Festivals:** Durga Puja in Kolkata is described as a massive, city-wide event with \e[0m\r\n\e[32melaborate pandals and decorations, deeply ingrained in the local identity. Paris's major events, while significant, seem\e[0m\r\n\e[32mto be more diverse in nature, ranging from large-scale music festivals to industry-specific events like fashion week.\e[0m\r\n\e[32m*   **Cultural Heritage:** Kolkata's festivals are deeply rooted in Bengali traditions and Hindu religious practices. \e[0m\r\n\e[32mParis's festivals, while also reflecting French culture, often have a more cosmopolitan and international appeal, \e[0m\r\n\e[32mdrawing from global trends in music, art, and fashion.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[32mIn summary, while both cities celebrate a variety of festivals, Kolkata's calendar is dominated by religious and \e[0m\r\n\e[32mtraditional celebrations deeply tied to its cultural heritage, whereas Paris offers a more diverse mix of cultural, \e[0m\r\n\e[32martistic, and secular events with a strong international flavor.\e[0m\r\n\r\n"
